# ARTEMIS UI Review and Project Overview

This document provides a review of the ARTEMIS application's UI, an overview of the project structure, and suggestions for improvement.

## Project Structure

The application is a Next.js project with the following structure:

-   **/app**: Contains the main application pages and API routes.
    -   **/api**: API routes for various functionalities like generating content, publishing, etc.
    -   `layout.tsx`: The main layout of the application.
    -   `page.tsx`: The main page of the application.
    -   `globals.css`: Global CSS file, including Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI setup.
-   **/components**: Contains the React components used in the application.
    -   `App.tsx`: The main application component that orchestrates the UI.
    -   `StepCard.tsx`: A component to display each step of the ARTEMIS workflow.
    -   `ThemeSwitcher.js`: A component to switch between different color themes.
-   **/hooks**: Contains custom React hooks for managing application state and logic.
-   **/utils**: Contains utility functions.
-   `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration file.
-   `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
-   `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration file.

## UI Framework and Styling

The application is built with the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **DaisyUI**: A plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of pre-built UI components.

## Application Functionality

ARTEMIS (Automated Real-Time Engagement & Marketing Intelligence System) is a marketing tool that automates the process of creating and publishing content. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Load Data**: Users can load data from a CSV file, which contains topics for content creation.
2.  **Select Topic**: Users can select a topic from the loaded data to work on.
3.  **Generate Blog Post**: The application generates a blog post based on the selected topic.
4.  **Generate SEO Data**: The application generates SEO-optimized data for the blog post.
5.  **Generate Social Media Posts**: The application generates social media posts to promote the blog post.
6.  **Generate Visuals**: The application generates visuals to accompany the content.
7.  **Publish to CMS**: The application publishes the content to a CMS.

## UI/UX Improvement Suggestions

The current UI is functional but could be improved in several areas to enhance the user experience and create a more polished look.

### 1. Component Styling and Consistency

-   **`StepCard.tsx`**: This component is currently very basic and doesn't use DaisyUI classes. It should be styled to match the rest of the application. For example, it could be turned into a DaisyUI `card` component with a title and a body. The "Reset" button should also be styled as a DaisyUI `btn`.
-   **`ThemeSwitcher.js`**: The theme switcher is a plain HTML `<select>` element. It should be styled to match the application's theme. A DaisyUI `select` component would be a good choice.

### 2. Visual Hierarchy and Layout

The main `App.tsx` component is a long list of sections. This could be improved by:

-   **Using a stepper component**: A stepper component would guide the user through the workflow and make the process more intuitive.
-   **Collapsible sections**: Each step could be a collapsible section, allowing the user to focus on one step at a time.

### 3. Loading States

The current loading messages are simple text messages. These could be improved by:

-   **Using DaisyUI's `loading` component**: DaisyUI provides loading spinners and other visual indicators that would make the loading state more engaging.
-   **Disabling buttons during loading**: Buttons that trigger long-running processes should be disabled and show a loading indicator to prevent multiple clicks.

### 4. Button Styling

The buttons in the `StepCard` component are plain HTML buttons. They should be styled with DaisyUI's `btn` classes to match the rest of the application.

By addressing these points, the ARTEMIS application can be made more user-friendly, visually appealing, and consistent.
